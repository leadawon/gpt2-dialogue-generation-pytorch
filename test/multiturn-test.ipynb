They all seems ot be the same group of people to me...  <sp2>  No, there's a definite difference. You know, the stockholders are the people who own the company... they're the financial control system. Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer. He's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. It's too dangerous. That's the reason for a Board of Directors. The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. They could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased. \n","user : <sp1>  How many people are on the board of directors? \n","res :  Just the people you name and your company name ; I guess most people on the board are people who are important to the company and important to its growth.\n"," gt :  Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 .
