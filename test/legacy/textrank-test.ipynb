I am trying to find a job asap . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it .\n","user :  Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now .

Please come in ! Come on into the bathroom . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . She is always flushing things down the toilet . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . I see . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !\n","user :  That would be great !

I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . So many dishes . I have the same idea as yours . The fish is not well-done and too salty . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?

You got it . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Could you give me some advice ? So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Yeah , that's very important . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . I'm going to have a job interview next week . I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . That ’ s right . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .\n","user :  It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . \n","res : You might say, Then, But I am totally lost when I think of that..\n"," gt :  It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . \n","summarized : No idea .

Your guess is as good as mine .\n","user :  It better be more than last year . \n","res : That sounds very good to me.\n"," gt :  Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . \n","summarized : What a pity ! I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .\n","user :  If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? \n","res : If it comes back today, we will be happy to discuss it.\n"," gt :  That's OK . \n","summarized : Good day !

Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy . And the chicken ? I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken . I've started eating better myself . Why aren't you eating anything else ? I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods . Those are the only things you eat ? That's basically what I eat . What foods do you eat now ?\n","user :  It's really healthy to eat when you bake it . \n","res : When you eat it, I feel good.\n"," gt :  I guess that does sound a lot healthier . \n","summarized : I am Peter Smith .
