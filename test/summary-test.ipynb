It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . You misunderstood me . You got it . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Could you give me some advice ? So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Yeah , that's very important . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . I'm going to have a job interview next week . I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . That ’ s right . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .\n","user :  It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . \n","res : Really?\n"," gt :  It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . \n","summarized : No idea .

I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .\n","user :  If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? \n","res : Ok.\n"," gt :  That's OK . \n","summarized : Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ? I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . Hello . Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ? It's NX567822100007 .
