I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?   Sure . First of all , it \u2019 s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don \u2019 t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .   Yeah , that's very important .   So you \u2019 d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .   I \u2019 ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .   That \u2019 s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .   It \u2019 s always easier to say something than to do it .   It \u2019 s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .   But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .   I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .   It \u2019 s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .   You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .   I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .   You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .  It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . ", "The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?   No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
